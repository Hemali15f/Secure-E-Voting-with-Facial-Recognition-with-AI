# Secure-E-Voting-with-Facial-Recognition-with-AI
This project focuses on revolutionizing e-voting systems by integrating facial recognition 
technology powered by machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The aim is to enhance 
identity verification and ensure a secure, tamper-proof voting process. By employing advanced 
facial recognition techniques, the system verifies voter identity in real-time, reducing fraud and 
eliminating the need for traditional identity verification methods. The integration of machine 
learning improves the system's accuracy and adaptability, while deep learning ensures 
robustness in diverse and challenging environments. This innovative approach enhances the 
reliability, transparency, and accessibility of e-voting systems, paving the way for secure digital 
elections.
